# amalgam
Amalgam provides a brutally simple webserver for no-nonsense news aggregation. Kinda inspired by [coven](http://www.coven.link/). 

Driving impetus is: 

* JS isn't needed if you're just aggregating news/links of interest
* humble hosting requirements
* Roll your own aggregation

See the roadmap for some of my upcoming ideas.
